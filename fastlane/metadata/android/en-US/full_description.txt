Whisper is an input method editor (IME) with voice recognition based on Whisper

It can work as standalone app and also offers an IME which can e.g. be activated
via the microphone button in HeliBoard.

At first start it needs to download the Whisper models from Hugging Face.
This is the only use of the internet permission.

Voice recognition works completely offline.

As standalone app Whisper can also translate any supported language to English.

To get the most out of Whisper:
- Press and hold the button while speaking
- Pause briefly before starting to speak
- Speak clearly, loudly, and at a moderate pace
- Please note that there is a limit of 30s for each recording
